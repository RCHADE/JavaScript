# Coure Apprire le JavaScript

those are my not after going through the cours [Apprendr le JavaScript](https://grafikart.fr/formations/formation-javascript) and this repisotory as all is my draft.

## The Console in JavaScript

The console is an essential tool for developers when debugging and logging information in JavaScript applications. It provides a way to interact with the JavaScript environment and output messages to the developer console.

- Definition

The console is an object provided by the browser's JavaScript environment that exposes various methods for logging information, debugging code, and interacting with the JavaScript runtime environment.

- Accessing the Console

To access the console in a web browser, you can open the developer tools by pressing `F12` or right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element." Once the developer tools are open, navigate to the "Console" tab, where you can type JavaScript code directly or view output generated by your scripts.

Alternatively, you can use the `console` object directly in your JavaScript code to log messages to the console:

```javascript
console.log("This is a log message");
console.error("This is an error message");
console.warn("This is a warning message");
```

## Les Variabls

- Creating Variable

you can do that by 3 diffent method the first one by :

```javascript
const a = 4
```

now you did creat a variable a holding the value 4 but if try to change the value that this variable is holding you will het a error message cuz you creat a constant variable 

the second way to create a variable is by :

```javascript
let a = 4
```

when you create a variable by using `let` instead of `const` the variable will be changabl

ther is also a third mehtod by using `var` instead of `let` or `const` and it will be changabl or just doing `a = 4`  which is quivilant of using `var` but this method is old and noone use it anymore for somreason.

- the type of variabls 

ther are plinty of them :

- `number` : like 2, 3, 4.28 ...ect
- `boolean` : `true` or `false` 
- `string` : anything list of charecter written between two `""` or two `''` or even two ` `` ` 
- `table` or `list` or `object` whatever the name is you can make them like this : `[3,4,5]` 
- `table`, `object` or like what we name them in python `dictionarry` you make one like this : `{'one':1,'two':2,'THREE':3}`

NB: manibilation this object in almost the same as in python so i am not bothering noting it down.

## Les conditions

- using the `if ()`
the genral forme of making a conditon is :

```javascript
const age = 29
let condition1 = age >= 30
let condition2 = age <= 20
if (condition1) {
    console.log('lacondition is correct')//you set here what do you want to happen if the condition is correct
} else if (Condition2) {
    cosole.log('first condition is false this one is not')
} else {
    console.log('all the previose condition were false unfortuntlly`)
}
```
in therm of making conditon you can make them by using `<` or `>` or even `==` or `===` but waite wath is the diffrent betwent the last two. so in javascript we have that `'1' == 1` is `true` but `'1' === 1` is `false`. Also another place wher you can notice how fucked up is the `==` is that when you make `[] == []` you would get false cuz they both are list that contain nothing but still not the sam list, that is maybe why popel avoid `==` and use `===` most of the time. Another syntax you will need while making condition is `!==` this mean diffreant.

There is also a plenty of thing that consider `true` like a number diffrent than `0` like `1` or `-5` and a not vide string like `'0'` and ther is also a plenty that cosdir `false` like `0` or a vide sting `''`

Also in condition you will need the use of `&&` as `and` and `||` as `or` so you can set more than one condition in the same `if (--here--)`. it is better when seperation the diffrent condition by `()` it just make evry thing clearer.

Another thing that you might youse while setting condition is using the `!condition` so no matter what was the `condition` is `true` or `false` the `!condition` will be the opposit.

- using the `switch / case`

the general form is :

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case valeur1:
    // Instructions to follow if the expression matche the first value
    instructions1
    break
  case valeur2:
    // Instructions to follow if the expression matche the second value
    break
  default:
    // Instructions to follow if the expression does not matche any value
    break
}
```

- the `prompt` function 

this course is not about it. It was mentioned so we can use in some exercice. Any way it work just like `input('blablabla')` in `python`
